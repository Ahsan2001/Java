// A file called Plankton.java, we could compile it with the terminal command:


// javac Plankton.java




// A successful compilation produces a .class file: Plankton.class, that we execute with the terminal command:

// java Plankton



// An unsuccessful compilation produces a list of errors. No .class file is made until the errors are corrected and the compile command is run again.
